    <h1>FA246: Assignment 3</h1>
    <p> In this body of work, I want to consider my creative practice within a commercial ecosystem, I want to consider this eco system because my family always say I should sell my work, and it is  a direction I would like to take my work. Specifically, I want to look into markets as they are a much easier commercial entry point than stores or galleries.
      Applying this ethical practice of transparency involves documenting as much of the process as I can and making that easily available when looking at anything being sold. I think the easiest way to do this is do display QR codes with the products on the stall.
      Most importantly, I want to find a system of creation that is ethical and can be easily combined with doing what I enjoy. That will be continuing with my Ceramic, Stone, Muka and Fabric practices for the remainder of this assignment.
      </p>
      <h2>Spectacular Translucence: Political Economy of Art and Open-source Software</h2>
      <h3>Baudrillard’s: a critique on the economy of the sign</h3>
      <p>The concept laundering process presents itself more evidently in the context of fine art as opposed to the rest of the retail economy because we can easily distinct its utility value from its symbolic value. This is because the value of art is for the most part existing in the land of signs and symbols. Sign exchange value relates to art for Baudrillard in the same way as commodity relates to possession for Marx.</p>
      <p>Any economic transaction is a hyperreal one wherein we exchange money (a sign the points to an economically agreed upon value) for goods/service (which is also a sign towards a culturally agreed upon value) which doubly reduces the perceived real action of exchange into that of hyperreal signs. Which is an unavoidable part of modern economic exchange. We can refer to utility value as an ‘inherent’ value that we are paying for, like with water/food/shelter/clothes, with the excuse that we require these things to live, hence they have inherent value. Monetary value given to these necessities is based in supply and demand (and inevitably how much companies can get away with profiting before experiencing backlash), despite any value given to necessities the value we attribute is purely cultural, at the end of the day it is all signs, all the way down. </p>
      <p>This is exactly why Baudrillard find looking at value of art so interesting, it is far easier to remove this utility value from a luxury expenditure, fully removed from any value of utility. Despite seemingly conflicting with the traditional economy of value based on their arbitrarily assigned value, they encapsulate the very insanity that goes into integrating cultural value into objects, creating a political economy informed by culture rather than the traditional supply and demand. </p>
      <p>Paintings are signs that point to the image the painter was trying to convey, but they also point to the larger oeuvre of the artist. It gains value through social labour be that of the artist themselves in making the piece, or in vendors or galleries in building up the cultural value of their oeuvre through exposure/networking. This style of assigning value to signs usurps traditional supply and demand, because each exchange transmutes the value of the work and the signs social coordinates and completely changed the works social relation; Once a painter has sold a work their work is now validated in art society.</p>
      <p>In this way the value of an artwork can be considered to be completely separate to its mode of production. Making it the epitome of a hyperreal transaction as its value goes “beyond value”.</p>

      <h3 id =”OSP”>Open-Source Philosophy</h3>
      <p>Open-Source Philosophy was originally influenced by the free software movement and from this established a culture of cooperation, coexistence shared by both communities to an extent but where both ideologies differ is the interpretation of ‘free’ software as a concept. Free software movement believed that software should be free/accessible to purchase , Richard M. Stallman  laid the foundations with the resolve to “give it away free to everyone who can use it” and judging people who sold software for dividing users with intent to conquer them, maintaining that profits can still be made operating under the ethics of free software, arguing that instead of buying and selling software it can be made through cooperation between users and companies, profits come instead from user support, modifications and other services. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The GNU manifesto outlines 4 freedoms required to be met as a part of free software:</p>
      <p><i>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose </i></p>
      <p><i>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs; access to the source code is a precondition for this</i></p> 
      <p><i>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor </i></p>
      <p><i>Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits; access to the source code is a precondition for this</i></p>
      <br>
      <p>Open source is the more capitalist interpretation of the free software movement, established purely in reaction to Free Software putting off investments with business partners in the tech industry. </p>
      <p>The fundamental difference between these two philosophies is ingrained in their relation to the political economy of software production. Both philosophies still treat code as a public good, the difference mostly comes in from where a revenue stream is created, where FS would argue that the 4 freedoms are a necessity for integrity, OS retains the freedom to interpret them more liberally in order to exist in a capitalist economy.</p>
      
      <p>Open source is the face of all these values because they have been more successful in the capitalist reality we live in. When I was introduced to this ethical philosophy I was introduced to it under the name of open source, when really its purest interpretation was created by Stallman for the Free Software movement. Now that OS is extending past its ‘niche in software production and gaining ground as a modus operandi in other fi elds (such as open content, open medicine, open education, open data, and so on), the OS movement finds itself again in closer proximity to the ideals expressed by the FS movement.’ But it is important to note that Open source still retains the ability to be neutral in economic/capitalist contexts, unlike the integrity of Free Source Ethics.</p>
      <p> It is kind of scary to realise that this philosophy I began to idealise has completely overshadowed its more ethical predecessor, and how it is beginning to spread while overlooking the ideological hopscotch that Open Source has to play with its foundational ideology  in order to exist at a profit in our current economic reality.</p>

      <h3 id=”WHY”>Why is all of this relevant?</h3>
      <p>Art and code are seemingly at conflict with each other but at their core both are essentially a luxury commodity, neither are direct necessities we need to live like water, food, or shelter. But both are somewhat omnipresent in western society to the point where you are culturally ostracised for not knowing about music/tv or barred from potential jobs for not having a phone or technical literacy. Both code and art engage with the relationship of surplus/abundance. They become cultural necessities, purely gaining value from the political economy.</p>
      <p>Code as a practice at least has the utility value of being able to carry out a certain task, for a certain purpose (although the value assigned is also completely cultural/political).</p>
      <p>The value of art is completely separate to its mode of production. Making it the epitome of a hyperreal transaction as its value goes “beyond value”. Instead gaining value through social labour be that of the artist themselves in making the piece, or in vendors or galleries in building up the cultural value of their oeuvre through exposure/networking. (2)</p>
      
      <p>Both examples transcendence the traditional meaning of contents. 
      Paintings are signs that point to the image the painter was trying to convey, but they also point to the larger oeuvre of the artist. This style of assigning value to signs usurps traditional supply and demand, because each exchange transmutes the value of the work and the signs social coordinates and completely changed the works social relation; taking it :beyond value”.</p>
      <p>In the  digital domain commodities are operating less in the field of capital but instead dawning a new age of techno feudalism(3), where instead of buying a material object we instead buy a licence to engage with a product. This practice exists largely in the domain of software but is turning to physical products like in the unfortunate example of the Nintendo switch2 (4). But more commonplace the domain of social media, while we don’t explicitly pay for it, where we are exploited for our data and not compensated, essentially giving free value to the owners of the domain.</p>
      <p>This troubling onset of techno feudalism is a brilliant example of why we need to bring back proper Open Source - Free Software values, applying them to every domain we can.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Applying this to creation could look like:</p>
      <p><i>Freedom 0: The freedom to use the work, for any purpose </i></p>
      <p><i>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the work was made, and adapt it to your needs</i></p>
      <p><i>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute the work so you can help your neighbour  </i></p>
      <p><i>Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the work, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits; </i></p>
      <br>
      <p>I am doing this by publishing all I can online in relation to my works and leaving all the code Open Source through GitHub.</p>
      <p>I believe that refining and ethical system for creation/commerce is really important. My issue with the anthropogenic state we are in is directly linked to capitalism, laundering concepts and the watering down of the origins of things for economic gain. The only way to combat this is through Open-Source creation.</p>
