  <h3 id="top">Concept Laundry and Spectacular Translucence</h3>
  <h4 id="human_concepts">Human Concepts</h4>

  <p>Around 1.5 billion years ago fungi diverted from animals on the evolutionary ladder, which was widely regarded as a great move. Over the course of several millennia different species of fungi were getting increasingly specialised, some poisonous, others pungent, but some psylocibous jokesters were messing with the brains of apes. The fungi would enjoy seeing the apes’ making fools of themselves and worshiping them for the inebriation they bestowed upon the lowly simian chumps. 
  This continued until 100,000 years ago when the apes started to share psychedelic trances. This accidentally kicked off the evolution of the homo sapiens. The primates started to be able creating realities separate from nature, and most dangerously they shared and spread these allusions. The real scare came when they created their own gods and all havoc broke loose. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After the humans started destroying the land on which everything thrived the mushrooms were left to grapple with the gravity of what they had created. In shockingly similar feeling to a hippie having come down after Woodstock having had the secrets of the universe on their arm, only to wake up and find in its place the phone number of an 80-year-old woman named Barb. Sufficed to say the fungi stopped having ideas and being creative after that point, much like when that same hippie got home only to be scalded by his mother and efficiently forced into an internship at a sales firm. </p>
  <p>Now the humans have gotten so out of control that they have brought a new geological epoch upon the earth, and nothing on this planet is safe from the chaos of the Anthropocene.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Regardless of whether the stoned ape theory is true it illustrates just how outlandish it really is for us to have the ability to pick out abstract concepts from the ether and convey them by simply contracting our larynx.</p>
  <p>It is widely accepted that what separates humans from ‘lower life forms’ is our ability to think… to consciously think… to think about thinking. Thinking is so essential to the human existence we cannot comprehend about how our thoughts control the way we interpret the world around us. Many philosophers have their own theories, but no one can step outside of the wiring of their brain. This ‘wiring’ of our brains begins as soon as we learn words.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <h4 id="concept_laundry">Concept Laundry</h4>

  <p>Language works a lot like money laundering, the stages of which are: Placement, layering, integration.
  Placement is when dirty money initially gets placed into the financial system, in the case of the casino this is when it is bet on a table.</p>
  <p><i>Layering</i> is when the money is “washed” by being placed through several transactions to disguise the origin of the money, i.e. continuing to make bets over a period of time.</p>
  <p><i>Integration</i> can happen after significant layering, once the origin of the cash is properly disguised and ‘clean’ it can be put safely in the bank without scrutiny. (1)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Language is inherently reductive, reducing real or conceptual things into sounds and characters. This is necessary for communication and all the good it brings into the world. When we invented a nail, instead of explaining the exact process that went into making it, we placed it into a much more convenient turn of phrase and called it a nail, similarly we took wood from a tree and instead of calling it a dismembered tree we call it wood. We layer these concepts when we put the wood and nails together and call it a chair, continuing to layer these concepts until it’s a dining set or a furnished house. </p>
  <p>These concepts seem clean because they have been integrated to the point that any processes or exploitation that were undergone to create it have been removed from conscious thought. </p>
  <p>It is necessary for progress. Putting knowledge into black boxes, people can specialise in their field without needing to know about anything else. Language is a black box for concepts. The further humanity develops, more things are put into black boxes, until we are so far integrated into a system of our own making, technology and economic systems seem more natural than the natural world.</p>
  <p>Looking through language-driven lens even reduces abstract human concepts like beauty and art down to an ‘overwhelming plethora of adjectives’ (2). There is no other way to communicate about art. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite all the progress, there are some abject horrors that result from ignorance for the sake of progress. When we put our waste into a black box, we joyfully pollute the world that has provided for us. When we put datasets into black boxes, we ignore the racist/sexist implications of these datasets that get used for things as important as the criminal justice system (3).</p>
  <p>Maybe we were always destined to end up in a mirage of our own making thanks to language.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h4 id="laundry_spectacular">Laundry Spectacular</h4>
  <h7><i>Signs symbols point to concepts in place of summoning real things</i></h7>
  <p>Meaning comes from two avenues ‘thinking the sense’ or ‘thinking the proposition’. Communication is a two-way street, and you are either thinking of something real in a sense and turning it into a proposition to convey it to someone else, or you are hearing a proposition and extrapolating it to a sense of a real situation. “Every sign by itself seems dead”, context in communication is key to imbuing signs with any meaning.(1)</p>
  <p></p>
  <h7><p>Division through dialectics and dichotomies layers these concepts into the place of ideas</h7></p>
  <p>Using dialects creates divisions, we can define specific things, not because of some inherent meaning in the sounds we are making, but rather because of all the things that aren’t what we are specifically mentioning. Birds are only birds because they aren’t humans, trees or windows. We construct a clean ‘purified’ definition of nature which exists separately to science, culture and society. (2)</p>
  <p></p>
  <h7><i>These concepts get integrated into our reality.</i></h7>
  <p>Leibniz discussed a hyporeality that deems “whatever is actual is only the realization of virtual possibilities that have always existed in the mind of God (3.1)". The conception of everything precedes the actualisation of the thing. i.e. we know the concept of 3:40pm tomorrow afternoon even though it has not occurred yet, or to Leibniz everything that actualises first existed in the virtual imagination of God. Leibniz’s <i>hypo</i>reality is virtual reality that precedes actualisation.</p>
  <p>Baudrillard instead suggests a <i>hyper</i>reality the virtual reality that proceeds actualisation. 
  A state of ‘more than reality’, where concepts feel more real than the physical environment we exist in. It speaks to the inescapable integration of referential signs that create conceptual systems which inform our culture. </p>
  <p><i>“Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.(3)” </i></p>
  <p>Disneyland is the perfect example because it has streamlined the concept laundering scheme, making real things out of its signs and symbols and distributing signs that represent those. This self-aggrandising reintegrative cycle exists intentionally to mask “something else and this "ideological" blanket functions as a cover for a simulation of the third order(3)”, it is a fake utopia by design to hide the ‘real’ America from tourists to turn a hefty profit.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><i>“In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.(4)”</i></p>
  <p>Debord understood that living in a world of referential signs would inevitably lead to a society of the spectacle, in which the signs come to mean more than their referents. The pleasure found in the world of the spectacle doesn’t come from its inherent beauty or value but by its trendiness. As a Marxist thinker the prominent danger he discusses is the rise of capital and mass media. Commodities are treated similarly “to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism(4)” a superficial and absurdly fetishistic pyramid scheme. Collectively conditioned to think that we need buy material commodities to survive, trained to ignore unpleasantness and indulge pleasurable hyperrealities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Prevailing world views are being driven by economy and capital in place of religion.  Abstract notions of value are informing systematic decisions and have directly led to the Anthropocene we live in. Religions and hyperrealities have potential for good, it just depends on the power wielding them. The planet is at a turning point and the Anthropocene is the result of bad faith of those in power and ignorance of the control we have over how we think and experience. (4,5,6)</p>
  <p></p>

  <h4 id="spectacular_transluscence">Spectacular Translucence</h4>
  <p>Why do we clean the kitchen? Just as a proxy of living dust gets everywhere, dishes pile up and forgotten food gets mouldy, it will never stop getting dirtier… yet we still put in the effort to keep everything clean because it is healthy for us and healthy for our kitchen. </p>
  <p>This is the exact reason we must strive for transparency and open-source knowledge as individuals, as artists and as a society at large. It is a never-ending struggle but its worthwhile maintenance we need to do to keep our minds and our environment healthy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Transparency is the only way to combat money laundering so a similar approach to stopping concept laundering should be applied to creative practice. Complete transparency is impossible in a world governed by language because open-source creation will always rely on signs and symbols. Despite this it’s still important to strive for transparency, this calls for consideration and documentation of materials used, and practice undertaken. <p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The best example I can find for an open-source creative practice is from the realm of computer programming. Open source is an ethical position held by brilliant coders that disagree with capitalisms privatisation and exploitation of knowledge. They counter this by supplying software and code for no cost (except for a donation from those who can afford it) often running their projects at a loss all for the ethical principle of sharing knowledge for the betterment of everyone. They keep everything open source by including documentation with their work to help fellow programmers or even novices to use/learn from their work. Creating an exciting and sustainable culture that values people and knowledge over the spectacle of what they can personally gain from creating code. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Open-source creation is antithetical to traditional fine art, over time this has become more accessible especially with the advent of the internet. The ability to learn how to create has become more available but has become synonymous with buying materials from a store in bulk only to never use it again. </p>
  <p>Conceptual artists started to make this move towards accessible art for audience engagement, but it has yet to fully dive into making the sharing of technical knowledge to be desired. Any art that is ‘easy’ to learn like sewing, crocheting, etc, is dismissed as crafting and is usually belittled in a fine art context.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <p>To fully appreciate the ability, we have as humans to deal in the abstract and create, we need to be careful that we are in control of what concepts we amplify, be it through though creation or by simply existing. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>We are never going to completely control the evolutionary magic that gave us this capacity for abstraction. Resisting the layering of signs, placement into hyperrealities and integration to the society of the spectacle is hard work. There is an unceasing force driving us towards complete abstraction, emphasising the dualities between us and our planet and tricking us into ignoring the land on which we depend. It is important work to be doing not just for us but for the betterment of the planet. The only way to tackle the Anthropocene is through an open-sourced mindset of transparency.</p>
